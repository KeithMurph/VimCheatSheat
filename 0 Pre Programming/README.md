# Sounds hard?
 So you want to dive into the world of computer programming? It might sound pretty intimidating or maybe even impossible at first but it's not! Anyone who has the dedication and the time can learn to code. Coding languages are actually far easier to learn than actual languages. For example english has over 273,000 words and a very inconsistent syntax. While most programming languages have about 100 words in their lexical library and have an incredibly strict syntax.
