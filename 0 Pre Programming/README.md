# Programming Basics

"The computer is incredibly fast, accurate and stupid. Man is unbelievably slow, inaccurate and brilliant. The marriage of the two is a challenge and opportunity beyond imagination"  -Unknown

# Sounds hard?
 So you want to dive into the world of computer programming? It might sound pretty intimidating or maybe even impossible at first but it's not! Anyone who has the dedication and the time can learn to code. Coding languages are actually far easier to learn than actual languages. For example english has over 273,000 words and a very inconsistent syntax. While most programming languages have about 100 words in their lexical library and have an incredibly strict syntax. 

## Helpful Skills

   ### Master Googling
-If Google isn't helping you either need more understanding of the issue or the algorithm you wrote is flawed

-Bad implementation of an algorithm can be solved through Google


# Core concepts of all languages 

 ##  Variables
   Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated
   <br>
   Every Variable has a type
   <br>
   Common Data types: Integer, String, Float, Objects 
   <br>
   Variables should have a starting value

 ## Operations
   How you manipulate variables
   <br>
   Vary by data type
   -Numeric: add, subtract, multiply, divide ...
   -Text: combine, search, split, iterate, transform ...
   -Conversion: convert from one type to another
   -Built in functions can be redefined 
   
 ## Input/Output
   ### Input
   -Get information from the user
   -Input implies an output
   -Input implies a variable to hold data
   -Forms

   ### Output 
   -Print something for the user to see
   -Outputs are typically text
 
 ## Branching
   -When an algorithm makes a choice between one or more things is called branching
   -True/False Expression 
   -If condition is true do X instructions
   -Else false then do Y instructions
   -Conditions can be nested within one another 
   -Switch Statements
   -And/Or

 ## Loops
   -How the computer manages repetition
   -All loops have a control variable sometimes called a sentry
   -Loops Have a Start
   -Loops have an End
   -An end condition that changes the sentry

   ### For loops
   -Deterministic: we know how many times it will loop
   -Operation will loop X times
   -The Sentry is typically an integer 
   -Used to iterate some sort of list
   -For Each 
   -Iterators

   ### While loops
   -Non-Deterministic: number of loops is unknown 
   -Sentry can be any type
   -End condition can be triggered by User Input or External Event 

 ## Functions
   -Allows you to create new commands for your code
   -Functions typically solve a smaller problem
   -Can take Inputs
   -Can produce Outputs
   -Variables in a function are locally scoped
   -Functions can create new instructions
   -Functions can generate or manipulate variables
   -Recursion

 ## Aggregate data
   -Multiple pieces of data combined into a single variable
   -Arrays
   -Lists
   -Classes
   -Dictionaries
   -Linked Lists
   -Trees
   -Databases 

 ## Classes
   -Hold elements of many types
   -Can contain variables(Properties)
   -Can contain functions(Methods)
   -Can guarantee am initial value(Constructors)
   -Can be combined and extended to make new things
